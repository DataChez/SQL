--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


--1. How many orders were placed in January?
Select* from BIT_DB.customers
where length(order_id)=6
and order_id<> 'Order ID';
Select Count(OrderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where OrderID<>'' and OrderID<>'...' and OrderID<>'OrderID';

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
Select Count(OrderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where Product='iPhone';


--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
Select customers.acctnum from BIT_DB.customers customers
left outer join BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales on customers.order_id= FebSales.orderID;

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
Select Product, MIN(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by product, price
order by price asc limit 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
Select sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Group BY product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select product, quantity, sum(quantity)*price as revenue, location
from BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group By Product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
Count (distinct customers.acctnum), 
AVG (quantity*price) 
from BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
left join BIT_DB.customers customers 
ON FebSales.orderID= customers.order_id
where FebSales.Quantity > 2
and length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';
